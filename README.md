# YelpCamp
YelpCamp web app completed as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

This app is designed to be a copycat of Yelp, while instead of reviewing businesses, you can review campgrounds! Here you can create an account, add your own campgrounds, edit/delete your campgrounds, leave reviews on any campground, and view all of the campgrounds on an interactive map. This project focused on CRUD implementation with RESTFUL routes, applying styling from various sources (in addition to customizing styling I did not write), and authentication and security.
